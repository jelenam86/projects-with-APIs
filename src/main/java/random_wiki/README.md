Project "Random Wikipedia Article" from [beginner-projects by Jorge Gonzales](https://github.com/jorgegonzalez/beginner-projects)

# [Project text:](https://github.com/jorgegonzalez/beginner-projects#random-wikipedia-article)
Create a program that pulls titles from the official Wikipedia API and then asks the user one by one if he or she would like to read about that article.
<br>Example:
<br>If the first title is Reddit, then the program should ask something along the lines of "Would you like to read about Reddit?" If the user says yes, then the program should open up the article for the user to read.
<br>Subgoals:
<br>Do something about the possibility of unicode appearing in the title.
<br>Whether you want your program to simply filter out these articles or you want to actually turn the codes into readable characters, that's up to you.
<br>Make the program pause once the user has selected an article to read, and allow him or her to continue browsing different article titles once finished reading.
<br>Allow the user to simply press ENTER to be asked about a new article.
