Project "Compare recent Reddit carma" from [beginner-projects by Jorge Gonzales](https://github.com/jorgegonzalez/beginner-projects)

<b>[Project text:](https://github.com/jorgegonzalez/beginner-projects#compare-recent-reddit-karma)</b>

Create a program that gets information about two different users, and then sees whose most recent post received the most karma.<br>
The program should then print out which user received more karma, and what the difference was.

<b>Subgoals:</b><br>
Allow the user to put in the name of two different users when the program first begins.<br>
If one of the names of the users does not exist (because of a spelling error), print out a message saying so.<br>
Allow the user to keep comparing other users until the program is closed.<br>
Display the amount of upvotes and downvotes each user received for their posts.
